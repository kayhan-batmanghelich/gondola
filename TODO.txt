------------------------------------------------------------
  X     0. random seeding 
        1. warm-up : multiple starts
        2. autmatic extraction of features after learning
  X     3. automatic ranking on basis vectors after learning
  X     4. group-sparsity for multi-channel
  X     5. an script that generate and check config file  -------> a template is stored in the data folder
  X     6. multi-class/ multi-label case ----> for this initialization.m need to change
  X     7. writing MOSEK find module
        8. replacin mosek with a free version
   X    9. parallelize the projection algorithm
   X    10. ITK image read/write 
   X    11. In documentaion, talk about normalization
  N/A   12. Try/replace your spg with Mark Schmidt version (it should be very easy)
        13. Possibly replacing .mat with .hdf5
        14. Multi-resolution initialization for full resolution case
   X    15. Create a log file for each experiment
   X    16. Either change the way the program extract features or make temporary file inside of the experimehnt folder
        17. If you don't use className, remove it!
   X    18. When code continues, Reports is replaced with a new one fix it!
        19. Interface with Nipype: http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipype/devel/matlab_interface_devel.html
        20. Add a sanity-check to paramSearch that each class should have more than one subject in order for param search to work
