| Package        | Version  | Description                                                |
+================+==========+============================================================+
| BASIS_         | 2.0      | A meta-project developed at SBIA to standardize and        |
|                |          | simplify the software development.                         |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| CMake_         | 2.8.4    | The build of the software packages developed at SBIA       | 
|                |          | is based on CMake, a cross-platform, open-source           |
|                |          | build tool. This tool can be used to configure the         |
|                |          | build system for various build tools which perform         |
|                |          | the actual build.                                          |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ITK_           | 3.18     | The ITK has to be build with the same compiler as the      |
|                |          | one used to build the MEX-files and MATLAB executable.     |
|                |          | Moreover, ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` and ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` has    |
|                |          | to include the ``-fPIC`` option for GCC.                   |
|                |          | Although there have been major changes in ITK 4.0, this    |
|                |          | software should also work well with this version of the    |
|                |          | ITK as only the image IO classes are being used.           |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Jython_        | 2.2      | Jython is a Java implementation of the Python language     |
|                |          | interpreter. It enables the use of Java classes in scripts |
|                |          | using the Python language and is in particular required by |
|                |          | the command-line tools which determine the best parameters |
|                |          | for each classifier and train them as these make use of    |
|                |          | the Weka Java API.                                         |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| LIBLINEAR_     | 1.8      | LIBLINEAR is a fast linear SVM solver used in the          | 
|                |          | GONDOLA optimization procedure. Make sure that you         |
|                |          | compile both LIBLINEAR and its MEX-files.                  |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| MATLAB_        | R2009b   | An important part of this software has been written        |
|                |          | in MATLAB. Note that the Image Processing Toolbox is       |
|                |          | in particular required.                                    |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Python_        | 2.6      | The scripts for the cross-validation experiments are       |
|                |          | implemented in Python.                                     |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| SBIAUtilities  | 1.0      | The ``sbiautilities.pyxel`` Python module                  |
|                |          | is used to read and write spreadsheets with the results of |
|                |          | the cross-validation experiments in the CSV format.        |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Weka_          | 3.7.3    | Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for    |
|                |          | data mining tasks. It is used for the classification task. |

|                           |          | of the `GNU Compiler Collection`_ (GCC) will work.         |
|                           |          | It is important to use a version which is compatible.      |

| MOSEK_                    | 6.0      | MOSEK is a large scale optimization software that is       |
|                           |          | used to optimize one of the blocks of the objective        |
|                           |          | function. Its use is, however, only recommended for those  |
|                           |          | continue the development of GONDOLA or methods based on    |
|                           |          | it. Otherwise, the default Spectral Projected Gradient     |
|                           |          | (SPG) optimization algorithm (``csolver``) should be used  |
|                           |          | which results further in a shorter execution time.         |
|                           |          | Moreover, MOSEK is not freely available.                   |

| `Oracle Grid Engine`_     | any      | Oracle Grid Engine software is a distributed resource      |
|                           |          | management system that manages the distribution of         | 
|                           |          | users' workloads to available compute resources. It        |
|                           |          | can be used to run several instances of the software       |
|                           |          | in parallel.                                               |

.. note: The stated package versions are the minimum versions for which it is known that
         the software is working with. Newer versions will usually be fine as well if not otherwise
         stated, but less certainly older versions.
