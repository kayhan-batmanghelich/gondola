Overview
========

This software implements Generative-Discriminative Basis Learning (GONDOLA),
which is explained in detail in [TMI2012]_ and extended later on in [MICCAI2011]_.
Theoretical ideas are explained in these papers, but as a brief explanation, GONDOLA provides
a generative method to reduce the dimensionality of medical images while using class labels.
It produces basis vectors that are useful for classification and also clinically interpretable.

When provided with two sets of labeled images as input, the software outputs
features saved in the Weka Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF) [#ARFF]_ and a
MATLAB data file. The program can also save basis vectors as NIfTI-1 images.
Scripts are provided to find and build an optimal classifier using Weka [#Weka]_.
The software can also be used for semi-supervised cases in which a number of
subjects do not have class labels (for an example, please see [TMI2012]_).
